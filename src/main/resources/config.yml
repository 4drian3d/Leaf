# The permission used to check if a player is able to vanish.
vanish_permission: "leaf.vanishable"

# Sometimes a vanishable player will be on an empty server.
# Unfortunately we can not check if the player is vanished or not.
# Because of this we assume the player is vanished.
#
# Setting this to true will let other vanishable players see
# vanishable players regardless of the rank.
#
# Defaults to false.
